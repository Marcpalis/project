                <div class="content">
                    <p>The first President of the Philippines was Emilio Aguinaldo, a prominent revolutionary leader. 
                        He played a pivotal role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule, which began in 1896. 
                        On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence in Kawit, Cavite, becoming the nation's first president. 
                        However, the Philippines soon fell under American control after the Spanish-American War, leading to the Philippine-American War. 
                        Aguinaldo continued to lead resistance against American rule until his capture in 1901. 
                        He later aligned with the United States and served as an elected president during the American colonial period. 
                        Aguinaldo remains a symbol of Filipino patriotism and the quest for independence.</p>

                    <p>The history of wars in the Philippines is a turbulent narrative of resistance, colonization, and internal strife.
                         It began with indigenous conflicts prior to Spanish arrival. 
                         Spanish colonization in the 16th century sparked resistance movements culminating in the Philippine Revolution (1896-1898). 
                         After a brief taste of independence, the Philippines fell under American control, leading to the Philippine-American War (1899-1902). 
                         During World War II, the country endured Japanese occupation and a subsequent campaign for liberation. 
                         Post-independence, internal conflicts emerged, including the Hukbalahap Rebellion and the Moro insurgency. 
                         Recent decades have seen efforts to address these issues and build a lasting peace. 
                         The Philippines' history of wars is a testament to its resilience and determination in the quest for sovereignty and stability.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The Philippines honors a select group of national heroes, each pivotal in the nation's struggle
                         for independence and identity. Jose Rizal, the quintessential patriot, used his intellect and
                          pen to ignite nationalist sentiments. Andres Bonifacio, the Katipunan founder,
                           embodied grassroots courage in fighting colonial oppression. Emilio Aguinaldo,
                            the first president, led the nation's initial bid for freedom. Apolinario Mabini,
                             the "Sublime Paralytic," contributed his political wisdom to the early republic.
                              These heroes symbolize the Filipino spirit of resistance and aspiration for liberty.
                               Their sacrifices and contributions continue to inspire the nation,
                                reminding Filipinos of their enduring commitment to sovereignty and self-determination.</p>
